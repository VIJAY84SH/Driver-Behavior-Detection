# Problem Statement :
The aim of this project is to develop a system capable of detecting and classifying driver behaviors using a CNN model. This system will analyze video data captured from inside the car and classify driver behaviors such as texting, talking on the phone,other Acivities , Turning or Safe Driving. The ultimate goal is to improve driver safety by providing real-time feedback or alerts to the driver or relevant authorities when unsafe behaviors are detected.

# Data Preprocessing:
The collected  data needs to be preprocessed before feeding it into the CNN model. This includes tasks such as resizing and normalization.

# Model Development:
A CNN model will be designed and trained using the preprocessed image data. The architecture of the CNN will involve convolutional layers for feature extraction, Pooling layer ( Max Pooling, Average Pooling) followed by fully connected layers for classification.

# Model Training:
The CNN model will be trained on the labeled dataset and tuned by Hyperparameter to achive higher accuracy.

# Evaluation:
he trained model will be evaluated using evaluation metrics such as accuracy assess its performance in classifying driver behaviors. 

# Testing :
Once the model demonstrates satisfactory performance during evaluation, it will be tested on unseen data to validate its generalization ability.

# Result:

# Conclusion:
The project concludes with a comprehensive analysis of the developed CNN model's performance in detecting and classifying driver behaviors. Additionally, recommendations for further improvements or enhancements may be provided based on the findings of the project. Finally, the potential impact of deploying such a system on improving road safety and reducing accidents can be discussed.
